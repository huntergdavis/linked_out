	- question: '	9/7/2019	Tim	Kuhn	, 	Avvo	, 	Senior Software Engineer	'
   answer: '	I have been a senior software developer with Avvo for approximately two years. When I began working with Avvo, Hunter was the acting Director of Engineering. He was the Hiring Manager when I interviewed; I was immediately impressed with him both as a technical leader and as a sincere, caring person.   Hunter was a uniting leader at Avvo. He encouraged all of us to find our place within the R&D teams, encouraging and enabling us to be our best. Hunter lead by mentoring and encouraging mentorship within the teams he was responsible for. Those of us who worked with him learned from him, enjoyed our time with him and became better technologists as well as better individuals.   I have worked with numerous leaders during my eighteen years in technology, few have made such a positive difference in my life as Hunter. I look forward to the day when I have the opportunity to work with him again. He is a magnetic and personable leader; he would be a magnificent addition to any to any organizationâ€™s Senior Management team.  	'
