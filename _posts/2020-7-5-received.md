 answer: '	Hunter is a strong, people focused leader. In the years I worked with him, I saw him grow brand new engineers into solid, confident developers while building his organization as a whole. Hunter is also passionate about creating high performing Agile organizations. He was constantly encouraging his teams to improve their agile practice while he worked to on pragmatic ways to resolve organizational rough edges. His focus on personal growth and team engagement has really served him well at Avvo, and I would recommend him at any engineering organization.	'
